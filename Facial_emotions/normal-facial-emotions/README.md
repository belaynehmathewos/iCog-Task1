# Facial Emotion
This app recognizes human faces and their corresponding emotions from a video or webcam feed. Performed by using OpenCV and Deep Learning, @iCog Labs Ethiopia.


## Deep Learning Model

The model used is from this [research paper](https://github.com/oarriaga/face_classification/blob/master/report.pdf)

---
* Computer vision impelemented by OpenCV.
* Neural network scaffolding impelemented by Keras with Tensorflow as backend.
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning architecture is from this [research paper](https://github.com/oarriaga/face_classification/blob/master/report.pdf).
* Pretrained Keras model and much of the OpenCV code provided by GitHub user [oarriaga](https://github.com/oarriaga).
